This is a static site generator that I wrote for use on my own site, https://adair.tech. 

## Why?

There are so many SSGs, you may wonder why I created my own. There are a couple of reasons:

- I wanted something that exactly fit my needs and what I was trying to do. Many SSGs that are available, come close to doing what I want, but not exactly.
- I wanted something very simple and fast.
- I wanted something opinionated, but in the way that I am opinionated.

## Issues/Contributions/Etc.

As I mentioned before, this was written for my own use and to scratch my own itch. It is very basic and is lacking a lot of features and a lot of customization options. 

That said, there are features that I want to add, and I will over time. Additionally, if there is a feature that you want, feel free to open an issue. I may or may not implement it. 

If I do not end up doing/implementing something that you want, feel free to fork the project and do with it what you will, it is one of the great things about open source, and this is under the MIT license.
