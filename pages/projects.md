## Current Projects

There are the personal projects that I am currently wortking on. These are all shared on GitHub under the MIT license unless otherwise noted. I want to make clear, that these are personal projects, designed and maintained to support my own interests and efforts. I am happy to share them with others, and if you can get use out of them, please do! However, I did not create any of these _for_ others. If you have suggestions, bug fixes, etc., please feel free to open an issue or better yet create a PR. If it is something that I will use, or at the very least does not interfere with how I use the project I will merge it in. If you have an issue that I do not address, or a PR that I do not merge, feel free to fork the project and modify it to meet your needs.

### DataForge

This is the Static Site Generator that runs this website. It is very simple, by design. I found that most of the SSGs that are out there, were way more complicated than I needed for my personal website. I created DataForge to make maintaining and updating my personal site quick and easy. It is built in Python and uses Jinja templates and Markdown for the posts and pages.

### docker-image-alma9-systemd

This is a Docker image of Alma 9 that has systemd included in it, which is not true of most Docker OS containers. I created this so I could use the image in the testing of my ansible playbooks that need systemd.

### aws-org-create-role

This is a Python script that I created to solve a problem I run into pretty reguarly at my day job. The need to create the same role across all of the AWS accounts in an organization. There are numerous ways to tackle this particular problem. But I have found this to be the fastest and easiest way for me to accomplish this task.

### MyBrief

This is the latest project that I have started playing with. It is a Python script/app that uses AI to summarize long articles so that I can get the gist of them faster. This is in its very early stages and I may or may not continue to develop it depending on how well it holds my interest.
