## About Me

### IT Professional, Cloud Enthusiast

Hi! I'm Brad Adair, an IT professional with over 20 years of experience in the industry. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work in a variety of roles, from hands-on systems administration to leading IT teams. My passion lies in the ever-evolving world of cloud technologies, and I'm always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise.

Outside of work, I'm a devoted husband and fatherof three. When I have free time, you'll likely find me geeking out over the latest tech, passionately debating politics, or cheering on my favorite football, hockey, and Formula 1 teams.

## About This Site

After going back and forth many times over the years with whether or not it was worth the effort to maintain my own site, I have come to the conclusion that it is. It is the one constant way for someone to share their thoughts, opinions, ideas, and more, without worrying about whether the platform it is being posted on is going to exist in a couple of years, or if it is going to be the kind of place that you want to visit in a few years. Social media seemed like the answer in the past, but as we have seen recently, that can change quickly. This is my space that I own and control. You will mostly find posts about tech stuff here, but there will likely be occassional political and sports posts thrown in from time to time.
