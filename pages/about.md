## About Me

### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Brad, a tech enthusiast with over two decades in the IT world. Throughout my journey, I've worn many hats - from hands-on systems administrator to leading IT teams. These days, I'm particularly fascinated by cloud technologies, which keep me constantly learning and exploring new possibilities.

When I'm not immersed in tech, I'm a proud husband and dad to three amazing kids who keep me on my toes. In those rare moments of downtime, you'll likely find me geeking out over the latest gadgets, diving into spirited political discussions, or shouting at the TV during football and hockey games. I'm also that person who wakes up at ridiculous hours to watch Formula 1 races live.

## Why This Site Exists

After years of flip-flopping about whether maintaining a personal site was worth the effort, I finally decided: absolutely yes.

In a world where platforms come and go (and sometimes dramatically change overnight), having your own little corner of the internet feels increasingly important. This space is entirely mine - no algorithm changes, no policy updates, no sudden platform collapses to worry about.

While you'll mostly find tech-related content here (it's what I do, after all), don't be surprised if the occasional sports rant or political reflection sneaks in. Consider this my digital living room - mostly organized but with a few personal touches that make it uniquely mine.

Thanks for stopping by!
